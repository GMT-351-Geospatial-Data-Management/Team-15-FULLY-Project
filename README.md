The aim of this project is to keep the databases of airports located around the world and show them on a map.We used laravel, php, javascript and mysql in the construction of this project.We also got a more effective result by using the leaflet, which is the javascript library, to add the map to the site.

## Role Adding

The site can be accessed in two ways.The first as an admin and the second as a user.Here, when we enter from the admin login, we have various functions, for example, adding roles, subtracting roles, adding airports, and so on.The admin login can also restrict the rights of users.We thought that the admin login was very important here in order to use the airport data base effectively.

## Adding Map and Transferring the data from the database to the map

The website displays all data for airports on the map, allowing users to visualize the information. This data can be added, deleted, and updated in real-time. The map is implemented using Leaflet, a JavaScript library. Markers on the map are automatically placed using location data from the airport database system. When a new airport is added to the database from any location worldwide, the map is automatically updated.
